<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>

    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</q> The farmer said, <q class="quote farmer"><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q> The farmer again said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> 
    
    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="quote villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too <q class="bad"> bad,”</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="quote farmer"><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="quote villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</q> Again, he said, <q class="quote farmer"><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></q>
    
    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><p class="good">good</p>Good and <p class="bad">bad</p> are just one perspective. Bananas are  <p class="good">good</p>for monkeys, but monkeys are not <p class="good">good</p> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
